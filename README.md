## Configure ExifGlass
ExifGlass comes with a specific version of `exiftool.exe` file. If you want to use a newer ExifTool release, follow these steps:
1. Download [ExifTool by Phil Harvey](https://exiftool.org). You can also use the [ExifTool Windows Installer](https://oliverbetz.de/pages/Artikel/ExifTool-for-Windows#toc-3) if you prefer, which will automatically register the executable file of ExifTool on your system. ExifGlass can detect it automatically.
2. If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract its contents into a folder, rename `exiftool(-k).exe` to `exiftool.exe`.
3. Open ExifGlass Settings (press <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd>) and go to "Executable path". Locate the `exiftool.exe` file that you extracted in step 2.


## Integrate ExifGlass into [ImageGlass 9](https://imageglass.org)
Please refer to [ImageGlass Docs / ImageGlass tools](https://imageglass.org/docs/imageglass-tools#add-your-tool-to-imageglass).

> [!TIP]
> Note that if you have installed [ExifGlass Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MX8S9HZ57W8), you can just use `exifglass` for the `Executable` field.
